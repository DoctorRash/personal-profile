<!-- Purpose -->
<!-- The primary purpose of this project is to create a personal project webpage using only HTML, focusing on structuring the
webpage with semantic HTML elements. The code snippet effectively addresses this objective by providing a well-structured HTML document 
that includes various sections such as About Me, Hobbies, Projects, Gallery, and Contact. The use of semantic elements like <header>, 
<section>, and <footer> enhances the clarity and organization of the webpage. However, the purpose could 
be further enhanced by including more interactive elements or additional content to fully showcase the creator's skills. -->

<!-- Requirement  -->
<!-- The code meets the requirements of creating a personal webpage using HTML. It includes all necessary sections and uses semantic
HTML elements appropriately. The inclusion of navigation links, images with alt text, and a logical heading hierarchy demonstrates 
attention to detail and adherence to HTML standards. The project could be improved by incorporating CSS for styling to enhance the 
visual appeal, but this was not a stated requirement. -->

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

<!--     Use Cases -->
<!--     The webpage is usable in the intended context of showcasing personal information and projects. The navigation links 
    function correctly, allowing users to scroll to different sections of the page. The content is organized logically, making 
    it easy for visitors to find information. However, the use case could be expanded by adding more interactive features or 
    integrating additional technologies like JavaScript to improve user engagement. -->
